# Used_Car_Price_Prediction
There's a huge market for used cars. The main reason people consider buying pre-owned cars rather than buying a new one is that they are more affordable. Car is a depreciating asset i.e it loses its values after being owned. But the price of the second hand car can be manipulated.
There comes the importance of this project. In this project, we will predict the fair value of the car based on the parameters.
